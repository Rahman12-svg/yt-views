# YouTube Viewer
Simple program to increase YouTube views written in Python.

**Disclaimer:** This has been developed for educational purposes only. Any action you take using this script is strictly at your own risk. I will not be liable for any losses or damages you face using this script.

**Cons:** Try not to use this script every day. Run this once or twice a week with newer proxies. Guess this will reduce the view decrease issue.

# View Decrease
 If you see views are getting deleted after a while, make sure you're using good proxies. Here https://github.com/MShawon/YouTube-Viewer/issues/46#issuecomment-806399397 a user confirmed about view stability with good proxies 

# Issues
 Before opening an issue, please read this page thoroughly. Maybe someone already faced the same problem you have right now. So it's always a good idea to check the answer from issues first. If your problem isn't there, feel free to open an issue.

# Requirements
 * Python 3.6+
 * High speed Internet Connection
 * Good proxy list (http, https, socks4, socks5)
 * Google Chrome installed on your OS (not Chromium)
 * Chrome driver will be downloaded automatically by undetected-chromedriver

# HTTP API
   Live logs fetched every 10 seconds and statistics in graphs are available on http://localhost:5000/ .Or [http://ip_of_your_pc:5000/](http://ip_of_your_pc:5000/) use this to access from another device under same network. A SQLite Database is being used  to store your generated views from this script. 
   Last 20 logs from scripts are fetched every 10 seconds to show on website and graph is updated every 5 minutes.

# Config.json
   No need to type everything everytime you run the script. A config file will be created automatically to save and use your preferences.

# Proxies
 Buy premium proxies from my referral link : [Webshare](https://www.webshare.io/?referral_code=8hd5him4soj1)

* ## Free Proxy
   Try not to use free proxies. But if you have a paid subscription and you want to use authenticated IP feature, then you can use the free proxy category.

* ## Premium Proxy
   Proxies with authentication can also be done. To do so put your proxies in this format **username:password@ipaddress:port** in a text file. Every single line will contain a single proxy. Provide your text file path when the script asks for a proxy file name.
   **N.B:** Only available for **http** type proxy.

* ## Rotating Proxy
   You can also use the rotating proxies service. You can either authenticate your IP on your proxy provider service and use *ipaddress:port* as Main Gateway. Or direct use username:password combo like this *username:password@ipaddress:port* as Main Gateway but this will only work for **http** type proxy.

# Urls
  Put video links in the urls.txt. For multiple videos place urls in multple lines.
  1) To find video link in YouTube click share and copy.
  2) If you have any external link which will redirect to your youtube video you can use that too. Example : when you post a YouTube video link in **twitter** and you hit play on twitter, you will get a link like this `https://t.co/xxxxxxxxxx?amp=1`. This is helpful because YouTube will see that views are coming from External Source like twitter in this example.

# Search
  Program can search youtube with keyword and find video with video title. To do this you need to know what keyword can find your video on youtube search engine. Also you need to provide **exact** video title.Put keyword and title like this format `keyword :::: video title` in **search.txt** 

  *If you don't know any keyword just put your `video title :::: video title` in search.txt*


# Windows
* ## Binary Release

      ```

   * After closing program, if chromedrivers are still running. You may want to double click **killdrive.bat** to close all chrome instances.
